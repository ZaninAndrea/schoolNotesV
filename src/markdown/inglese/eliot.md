# Eliot
## Life
Thomas Stearns Eliot was born in 1888 from an english family, he studied at Harvard and at the Sorbonne. When the World War I broke out he left Germany and went to Oxford.

In 1921 he almost had a nervous breakdown and was treated in Margate and the in Lausanne (switzerland).

In the late 20s and 30s he found in religion a way out of nihilism.

In 1948 he won the Nobel Prize and was appointed the British Order of Merit.

## Works
His first work was *The Love Song of J.Alfred Prufrock*, published in 1917, his first successful work is ***The Waste Land***, first drafted while in Lausanne and revised by Ezra Pound.

After the sucess of The Waste Land he became the leading english modernist poet and left his job. This period culminated with the play *Murder in the Cathedral* (1935).

After Word War II Eliot was mostly occupied with drama, criticism and reviewing. ==He treated religion and morality through sophisticated social comedies.==

His literary criticism was as great as his writing, though not as appreciated due to the pitiless attacks on modern society.

## The Waste Land
The Waste Land has been particularly important, because definitely abandoned the late Victorian models and greatly influenced the future poets.

It expresses Eliot's **disillusion** with the world, the search for a new tradition, it's the culmination of his nihilism.

The main topic the **decay of western civilization**, the poet sees only ruin and destruction around him. The fragmentation of the poem reflects the fragmentation of society.

Using various images quotations from myths and legends Eliot describes the waste land whose ruler, the **Fisher King**, brought sterility to the land. 
==The order of myth is projected onto the chaos of modern life.==

The poem lacks a logical continuity, it instead procedes through free association of thoughts (**stream of consciousness**).

He uses the free verse, although there are some regularities and rhymes.

# Joyce
## Life
Joyce was born in a middle-family, his father was a supporter of the Home Rule for Ireland, but after Parnell's death (the leader of the movement) he retired from politics. This made him the representative of the **failures of Ireland**.

In 1902 Joyce self-imposed the exile, because life in Ireland was an obstacle to his artistic development. In Trieste he finished ***Dubliners*** and *A Portrait of the Atist as a Young Man*.

At the outbreak of World War I Joyce moved to Zurich, where he began to write the ***Ulysses*** (in which he embraced the stream-of-consciousness technique). He published it in Paris, where he also wrote ***Finnegans Wake***.

## Themes
Although he left Dublin, the city remained the main topic of all his works. He chose exile to gain an emotional and intellectual detachment.

Throughout Joyce's works we see ==a shift from the particular to the universal== and from the lyrical style to the epic style.

## Dubliners
Dubliners is a collection of 15 short stories, in each one the failure of self-realization of a Dubliner is examined.

Joyce focuses on the idea of the **paralysis of will** that leads people to accept the limitations of their social context.

Though it recreated in extreme detail the environment of Dublin, Joyce also employed a subtle symbolism to shine a different light on ordinary objects. He used the term **epiphany** do descrbe an object making someone realise their condition (e.g. Gretta hearing the song)

In the last story, *The Dead*, the narrator's objectivity is replaced by lyrical intensity and a more compassionate view of the people of Dublin.
In the end the protagonist, Gabriel, abandons his frustrations and regrets and the union of the living with the dead is symbolized by the snow.

# Virginia Woolf
## Life
She was educated at home, her family and acquaintances were literates. She had been **mentally instable** for all her life, having various periods of depression and even attempting suicide.

Her house in London was the centre for the **Bloomsbury Group**, an exclusive group of writers, they were anti-Victorians, sceptical about religion and left-wing in politics.
She has been an activist for the rights of women.

World War II was too much for her to bear and she drowned herself.

## Style
She employed the stream of consciousness technique, indirect narration and the **interior monologue**.

Her use of the time reflects her modernist ideas of plot, character and language.
The plot covers only short stretches of time, but they are expanded by the links that the mind makes. She expresses this through the ideas of the **time of the clock** and **time of the mind**.

## Mrs Dalloway
Its the story of an **ordinary day** in the life of Clarissa Dalloway. Woolf rejects the idea of the eventful plot and instead focuses on the interaction between the character's thoughts and the external reality, to do so she makes great use of the interior monologue.
