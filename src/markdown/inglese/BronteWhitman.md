# Emily Brontë
## Life
Emily Brontë's parents were both of **celtic origins** and this gave her a background of fantastic storytelling and belief in feeling and impulse over reason.

She grew up in the desolate Yorkshire **moors**, in which she will set *Wuthering Heights*.

Although living in a remote place, Emily grew up in a literate environment.

She died at the age of 30 in 1848.

## Works and themes
Emily's first work, a collection of poems written together with Anne and Charlotte, sold only 2 copies.

She became successful upon publishing _**Wuthering Heights**_ in 1847, one year before dying.

**Passion and feeling** are shown at their strongest in her work, she shows a desire to break through life's conventions.

## Wuthering Heights
The novel tells the life-long passion between **Heathcliff** and **Catherine**, it's the first time that **passionate love** appears in the Victorian literature.

It draws on the Romantic idea of feeling over reason, but also anticipates the late Victorian gloomy vision of life.

Heathcliff is a **dark Romantic hero**, dominated by his self-destructive passion, however the main character is Catherine, oppressed and divided by **social conventions**.

She follows social conventions into marrying Edgar Linton, although she truly loves Heathcliff.

The story is narrated by 2 narrators, one of which is Nelly Dean, maid and confidante of Catherine.
