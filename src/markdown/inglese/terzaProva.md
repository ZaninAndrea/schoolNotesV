# Jane Austen
## Biography
Jane Austen was born in 1775 at Steventon, she was educated at home and **started writing verse and drama at early age**. She first started to draft her novels in 1795, but they got published only several years later.

After living in Bath for a while, she moved to Chawton (not far from Steventon), this marked her most fruitful period as a writer.  
In 1811 she published anonymously ("by a lady") *Sense and sensibility* and was well received by the critics, but her most famous book is ***Pride and Prejudice***.

## Style
Jane Austen sets all her novels in the **provincial southern England** where she lived, the characters generally belong to the rural middle class, the landed gentry and the clergy.
They are **very precisely described** in particular we are given a very clear view of their place in society.  
Austen's skill as a writer is shown by the **psychological insights** and the lively **round characters**.

**Her novels are quiet**, the characters well mannered, the only exciting element is love, not passionate or tragic love, but a **polite love**.  
Austens satirizes the **exaggerated sentimentality of contemporary novels**, and rejects a purely romantic and sentimental view of love.

The **witty and ironical dialogues** render common characters interesting. Austen doesn't present heroes, but smiles at human frailties.

The didactic aim of her novels and the use of irony detach her from the romantic genre of the time.

## Pride and Prejudice
Set in the countryside of southern England *Pride and Prejudice* is centered on **love and marriage**.  
The plot revolves aroung Elizabeth Bennet, at first she gets courted by Bingley and is herself attracted by him, but in the end she realizes that her prejudice against Darcy was wrong and marries him.

In this novel Austen satirizes **the desperate search for a husband**.

# Mary Shelly
## Biography
Mary Shelly was brought up among ideals of concern for her fellow beings. She fell in **love with Percy Bysshe Shelly**, with whom she **traveled across Europe**, until they settled in **Geneva**, where Lord Byron joined them.

She started writing *Frankenstein* as a challenge posed by Byron and published it in 1818.
She wrote 5 more novels, the best of which is *The Last Man*.

## Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus
### Themes
In this novel Shelly modernizes the ancient dream of the **creation of artificial life**. It could be defined both a philosophical romance and a Gothic tale.

She merges the Romantics' interest in the **effects of science on man** and the macabre of the **Gothic tales**. She takes the emotional language and the atmosphere of **suspence** from the Gothic novels, but **substitutes the supernatural with science**.  
For treating the theme of scientific research and its philosophical implications, *Frankenstein* is considered the forerunner of science fiction.

**Dr. Frankestein's character was inspired by Faust**: he wants to have a God-like power, he wants to create life.  
On the other hand **Frankenstein's monster** is a Romantic dark hero: outcast of society, suffering for no fault of his own.

### Style
Frankenstein is told in **first person** by 3 non-omniscent narrators: Robert Walton (an explorer), Dr. Frankenstein and the monster.  
The novel starts with a letter from Walton to his sister, then there is the **autobiography of Dr. Frankenstein** and **a report by the monster** and finally it concludes with another letter from Walton.

# The Victorian Age
## Historical setting
### An age of industry and reform
When Queen Victoria (1837-1901) came to the throne, **the poor still endured apalling conditions**, aggravated by a crisis of industry and agriculture.  
In 1867 a Reform Bill **granted town workers the right to vote**, but not miners and agricultural workers, in 1884 the suffrage was extended to all male workers.

England adopted **free trade** and in 1851 in London a **Great International Exhibition** was held.
The industrial development was fast: **railways** quickly covered much of the country and **steamboat** services connected England to the rest of the world. The telegraph was invented and London was the first city to have **gas lighting**.

With the **Poor Law** of 1834 poor were amassed in **workhouses** that closely resembled jails. In large cities **urban slums** developed.

Various social reforms were passed: women and children employment in mines was forbidden, **unions were legalized** and catholics were accepted in the government.  
During this period the Conservatives, the Liberals and the Labour Party were born.
