## Dickens

### Life

Charles Dickens was born in **Portsmouth** in 1812. When he was 10 he moved to London and ==at 12 he was forced to go to work in a factory==, this experience was traumatic and will influence heavily his future work. At 14 he went to work as a clerk in a legal office, here he developed a contempt for the lawyers and the law.

His first work is _Sketches of Boz_, soon followed by his first novel: _**The Pickwick Papers**_.

### Themes

Dickens was conscious of the political injustice and incompetence, the poverty and the suffering of the masses, ==this lead to him having a very critical attitude towards society.==

In _**Oliver Twist**_ he recounts the suffering of an orphan, in _**Hard Times**_ he deals with the factory system and the harm done by the utilitarian philosophy. Then we have _Dombey and Son_ and _Bleak House_ before his masterpiece: _**David Copperfield**_, which is mostly autobiographical and deals with the loves, pains and wonders of **childhood**.

### Characters and setting

Dickens' novels present a variety of settings: the countryside, the provincial towns, the industrial settlements, ... but his most typical one is **London**.

==His characters are mainly from the lower and middle classes==, when Dickens tries to portrait the upper class he usually falls into stereotypes. The characters are frequently divided into **good and bad** ones.

Dickens' plots involve many characters and many parallel stories.

### Style

Dickens is a master of the english language, ==he combines the pathetic with the comic==, social criticism with lively portraits.

His ability to create dialogue is unmatched by any other English novelist. Through **humor** he manages to hide the melodramatic or didactic passages.

Dickens influenced heavily his contemporaries and successors. Modern critics descrbe his work as ==combining social realism with symbolism== as a device to represent social conflict and evil.

### Oliver Twist

Oliver Twist is Dickens' most famous novel and came out in **instalments**. It tells the story of an orphan who manages to preserve his good character despite a very hard life.

Dickens combines the sentimental with social satire and realism

## Oscar Wilde

### Life

Oscar Wilde was born in 1854 in Dublin, he studied in Oxford and here he joined the **Aesthetic movement**. He was a brillian talker, a dandy and an aestethe and cultivated an extravagant, insolent wit.

In 1881 he went to the USA to give a series of lectures. In 1883 he married **Constance Lloyd**, who bore him 2 children.

He became successful in 1891 with the novel _**The Picture of Dorian Gray**_ and then wrote some light comedies, the most important of which is _**The Importance of Being Earnest**_.

In 1895 he was arrested and sent to hard labour because of his homosexuality, this was a trauma he never recovered from. This experience inspired his _The Ballad of Reading Gaol_ and _De Profundis_, but when he left prison he was a broken man, he died alone 3 years later \(1900\) in a small hotel in Paris.

### Aesthetic movement

The main belief of the aesthetic movement is that ==art should be detached from social and moral issues==: Art for Art's sake.

They believed that the only way to give a meaning to existence is living **hedonistically**, devoting oneself to pleasure.

Wilde became the leader of the aesthetic movement, this philosophy is however not present in his latter works, after the period in prison.

### The Picture of Dorian Gray

This is the **only novel** by Wilde and also the work that best reflects his aesthetic theories: ==for Dorian the pursuit of pleasure and beauty was the true purpose of life== and life itself was the greatest of the arts.

The novel contains an element of mystery throught the story, while its ending is in line with classic horror and crime stories.

Although the story doesn't seem to have any moral considerations, the ending implies something that is clearly stated in the _De Profundis_: ==there is a price to be paid for a life of pleasure==.
