# BronteWhitman

## Emily Brontë

### Life

Emily Brontë's parents were both of **celtic origins** and this gave her a background of fantastic storytelling and belief in feeling and impulse over reason.

She grew up in the desolate Yorkshire **moors**, in which she will set _Wuthering Heights_.

Although living in a remote place, Emily grew up in a literate environment.

She died at the age of 30 in 1848.

### Works and themes

Emily's first work, a collection of poems written together with Anne and Charlotte, sold only 2 copies.

She became successful upon publishing _**Wuthering Heights**_ in 1847, one year before dying.

**Passion and feeling** are shown at their strongest in her work, she shows a desire to break through life's conventions.

### Wuthering Heights

The novel tells the life-long passion between **Heathcliff** and **Catherine**, it's the first time that **passionate love** appears in the Victorian literature.

It draws on the Romantic idea of feeling over reason, but also anticipates the late Victorian gloomy vision of life.

Heathcliff is a **dark Romantic hero**, dominated by his self-destructive passion, however the main character is Catherine, oppressed and divided by **social conventions**.

She follows social conventions into marrying Edgar Linton, although she truly loves Heathcliff.

The story is narrated by 2 narrators, one of which is Nelly Dean, maid and confidante of Catherine.

## Walt Whitman

### Life

Walt Whitman was born in New York in 1819 from a poor family. He had little education and started working at an early age.

In the 1840s and 1850s ==he travelled throughout the USA==, getting to know its people, that will be the subject of his poetry. The Civil War was a shock for him.

He died in 1892 after revising his poems.

### Leaves of Grass

The only work of Whitman is _Leaves of Grass_, he first published it in 1855, but ==kept revising and adding poems== for all his life. The fame of the collection kept growing steadily.

The theme of the collection is **America and its people**, his poetry reflects his philosophy of inspired individualism and the **glorification of the self**.

He sees himself as the incarnation of the country's spirit and geography.

He used the **free verse**, that he invented, to reflect the rythm of the ordinary language. ==His language is simple== yet passionate, sometimes colloquial; he didn't use much metaphors and similes, because he preferred direct statements.

## The Modernist Revolution

### The loss of certainty

At the beggining of th 20th century **skepticism** started to emerge among intellectuals.

Nietzsche's moral relativism and Einstein's relativity destroyed the vision of the worlds as certain and understandable.

Freud's discovery of the unconscious gave intellectuals something to hold on, because it meant that consciously or unconsciously human behaviour followed a pattern.

### Modernist literature

Modernist destroy traditional time, space and literary genres leading to **the collapse of the traditional plot** \(clearly defined characters, settings, beginning and end\). Their language reflects their **rebellion against tradition**: they use a complex language that often ignores syntax, grammar and punctuation. For example they use the free verse.

They put and emphasis on **psychological truth** and integrate different myth, philosophies and traditions.

A key topic for the first-generation modernists is the **unconscious in daily life** and to describe it they often used the **stream of consciousness** technique, as we see in Joyce's _Ulysses_.

Altough inspired by the iconoclastic movements of the early 20th century \(Cubism, Futurism, Dadaism, Surrealism\), they considered the past valuable, myths in particular.

From the mid-20s the artists started taking a political side, most of them turned to **political left** and some even went to fight in the **Spanish Civil War** against Franco.
